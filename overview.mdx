## Authorize End User Connection With Strada Link

To securely authenticate an end user's connection to an accounting platform you will need to:

1. Get a token to access Strada Link
2. Initialize Strada Link component in your app
3. Receive a public token after your user authenticates
4. Exchange the public token for a private one

These steps are outlined in detail as follows:

**1. Get a token to access Strada Link**

In your backend, create a POST request to get a `link_access_token` from this URL:

`https://<ENV>.api.getstrada.com/v1/link/link_access_token`

Pass in your Strada API key as an `Auth` header (`--header 'Authorization: Bearer sandbox_2a48c2a4-bc1f-4537-a89b-1058ca4f916e'`). See the POST request body and API response here.

**2. Initialize Strada Link component in your app**

Strada Link is published to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stradahq/strada-link-react) as a React library. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/strada-api/strada-link-react). You can install this library using:

`npm i @stradahq/strada-link-react`

After installing the library, add it to your project:

`import { StradaLink } from '@stradahq/strada-link-react'
`
To invoke `useStradaLink` you need to provide an `env` (one of `sandbox`, `prod`), `linkAccessToken`, `onSuccess` call back function.

**3. Receive a public token after your user authenticates**

Once the user finishes authenticating and `auth_success` page is received, `onSuccess` method will be invoked and a `public_token` will be returned.

**4. Exchange the public token for a private one**

In your backend, swap `public_connection_token` for a private `api_connection_token`. See the POST request body and API response here.

Store the `api_connection_token` in your database as it will be used to authenticate future accounting API requests for this given end user.
